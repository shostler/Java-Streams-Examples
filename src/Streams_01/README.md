Dive in.

Same code done with loops and streams.

Focuses on what to do vs. how to do it.

Loop Approach
   Mixes that "what" with the "how"
   sequential
   focus is on each individual element.

Streams Approach
   Says what to do
   may be sequential or parallel
   no explicit mutations.
   not focusing on individual elements, but the collection.
